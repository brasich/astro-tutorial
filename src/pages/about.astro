    <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

    <p>This site is being created as part of Astro's introductory tutorial</p>
    <p>If I enjoy this framework, I might consider using this for the GMRC project</p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}</li>
        <li>I live in {identity.country}</li>
        <li>Two of my hobbies are {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}</li>
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
        {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>

    {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}
    {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}
    {goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
